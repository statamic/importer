## Installation

You can install the Importer addon via Composer:

> **Note:**
> Before installing the importer addon, please ensure your project has a database configured. The importer uses a database to keep track of import progress. If you created your site using the [Statamic CLI](https://github.com/statamic/cli), a SQLite database will have been setup for you. You can confirm by running `php artisan migrate`.
